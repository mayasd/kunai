How to get agent informations (pid, port, state, etc)
=====================================================

   kunai info


Is there an UI avialable?
=========================

Yes. There is a UI available in the /var/lib/kuani/ui/ directory. It's just flat files and so you can just export the directory with apache/nginx and play with it.


How to add new nodes in the node cluster?

First you need to install and launch the node in another server.

Then in this other server you can launch:
  
   kunai join  OTHER-IP

You can list the cluster members on all nodes with :

  kunai  members

And you will see the new node on the UI if you enable it



How to see collected data? (metrology)

The kunai agent is by default getting lot of metrology data from your OS and applications. It's done by "collctors" objets. You can easily list them and look at the colelcted data by launching:

  kunai collectors show
